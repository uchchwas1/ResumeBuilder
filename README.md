# Resume Builder

Resume builder is a web app that is built on Laravel, the PHP framework. The app is built to make a resume for a user. Anyone can sign-up and login to build his/her resume. For building this resume this app needs some information about you. You need to fill the necessary information. And after giving all information this app generates a PDF file for you and you can also preview the resume you build. It's very easy to use and time-consuming.

## Installation
